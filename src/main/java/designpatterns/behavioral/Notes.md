# Structural Design Patterns

## Introduction
Structural Design patterns provides the different patterns of creating class structures through inheritance (is-a relationship)
and composition (has-a relationship). Each design pattern is created for a specific purpose and they evolved over a period
of time in order to facilitate re-usability, impose security, enable smartness etc
 
## [Proxy Design Pattern](https://github.com/nramanath/Design-Patterns-Java/blob/master/src/main/java/designpatterns/structural/proxy/ProxyDesignPatternNotes.md)
Proxy pattern intent is to “Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it”. The definition 
itself is very clear and proxy pattern is used when we want to provide controlled access of a functionality.
